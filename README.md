# binary_search
This small project is a sligthly adapted version from that provided by @free_code_camp. The purpose is to compare searching linearly vs. in a binary manner in Python and show that binary search is faster than linear search. Two separate functions are provided for the purpose of searching linearly and with binary search, respectively. Then, using the random library in Python, a sorted list containing randomly generated integers in a given range and of length 10000 is created. The time library is used to calculate the different amount of time it takes for the two functions to find a given target number in the list.
